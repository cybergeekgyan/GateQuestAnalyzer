# GateQuest Analyzer

## Overview

GateQuest Analyzer is a deep learning model designed to analyze past years' question papers of the Gate computer science exam. The model aims to discover patterns, topics, and subtopics that are most frequently asked in the exams. It provides valuable insights into the recurring themes and assists students in focusing their preparation on high-priority areas.

## Features

- Analyze past years' question papers from the Gate computer science exam.
- Identify main topics and subtopics that frequently appear in the papers.
- Discover patterns and recurring question types.
- Generate new questions based on specific topics and subtopics.
- Evaluate the difficulty level of questions using a ranking system.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a diverse and extensive dataset of Gate computer science exam questions, including their topics, subtopics, and difficulty levels. The dataset is collected from authorized sources and preprocessed to ensure accurate analysis.
